### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Whether Publication date Affected the Length and the theme of Philosophy Schools'Sentences.
+ This project is conducted by [Jiaxi Fang]

+ Project summary: This project is based on the data set of a data science bootcamp at Flatiron School. In this data set, the author have recorded a large number of sentences of different authors of different philosophy schools in the history. In studying this data set, I'm interested in if different publication dates can affect the lengths and themes of these sentences. Applying data mining, statistical analysis, and visualization, I finally get the conclusion that publication date can affect these sentences indeed.
